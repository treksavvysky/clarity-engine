# Tools (Stage 0)

This directory is reserved for deterministic packet tooling:
- `compose_packet.py` will emit markdown packets, normalized manifests, and context hashes.
- `lint_packet.py` will validate manifests against `pcp_lite.schema.json` and sanity-check content.

Stage 0 does not ship runtime tools; add documentation or design notes only.
