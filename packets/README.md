# Packets Directory (Stage 0)

Reserved for generated Context Packet artifacts. Future conventions:
- `packets/<context_sha>.md` — rendered packet text
- `packets/<context_sha>.json` — normalized manifest

Do not commit runtime data dumps; only include intentional fixtures or examples aligned with `pcp_lite.schema.json`.
