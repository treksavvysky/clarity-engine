# Documentation Overview

This directory holds narrative and reference documentation for Clarity Engine.

- `compose_packet_explained.md` captures how packet manifests are transformed into the rendered packets and hashes.
- `vision/` contains the long-lived mission and staged roadmap artifacts (Stage 0 references, Stage-01 mission and summary).

Stage 0 is currently frozen; update docs here when scoped behavior or staged plans change.
