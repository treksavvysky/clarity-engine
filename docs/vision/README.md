# Vision Artifacts

Long-range intent and staged plans live here. Key references:

- `mission.md` — extended mission statement and principles for Clarity Engine.
- `architecture.md` — planned architecture; intentionally dormant while Stage 0 is frozen.
- `STAGE-01-MISSION.md` — constraints and objectives for exposing existing packet logic via FastAPI.
- `STAGE-01-SUMMARY.md` — summary checkpoint to consult before working on Stage-01 substages.
- `STAGE-01-CONTRAINS.md` — Universal constraints for all Stage-01 substages.

Keep these documents synchronized with the active stage and update them as stages are frozen or advanced.
