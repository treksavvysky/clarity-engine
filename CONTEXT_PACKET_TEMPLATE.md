**Usage Notes**
- Keep each bullet factual, testable, and concise.
- Maintain section order; do not omit required sections even if a list is brief.
- Align field names and content with `pcp_lite.schema.json`.
- Update `Version` when the schema or template meaning changes.
- If a field is intentionally empty, state why rather than omitting it.
